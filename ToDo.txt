@reader.py
- parse_packet_head only parse ipv4 packets.
+ need to process also ipv6

@featurizer.py
- extract_features use device id try with IP (for WAN) and MAC ( for LAN)
- play with     "source identifier": "IP", at config.json
- processing port no as a feature needs long list (need to be optimized)

------------------
"duration" determine the length of the session (group of connection in happen in the duration time)
           see sessionaizer @reader.py
           (Duration of session bins. None, null in json, uses a single bin for the entire pcap)
"session threshold" determine when to start collecting session packets.
                start after the first packet in the file by session threshold.

"max port" used in featurizer to init list with all posible ports (max port),
then each connection in a session will increase port value by 1.
